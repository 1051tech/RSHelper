# RSHelper
Wrapper for helpful RuneScape scripting (not botting, no automation of in-game tasks).
*MagicTrainer script is for testing out helper wrapper functionality, not for in-game use.*

# Updates
v0.2:
- Did major cleaning of files
- Changed script base class to interface
- Implemented CS-Script package
- Pretty much got to the point where everything is working except for the compilation of my scripts...
-- TestScript DOES work?

# TODO:
Figure out why CS-Script is rendering my scripts invalid because they really really... REALLY aren't.
